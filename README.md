## üö¶ Project: OLAP-Based Multidimensional Analysis of US Accident Data

### üîç Overview  
This project involved the design and implementation of an OLAP cube to analyze the **US Accident dataset**, with the goal of uncovering deep insights into traffic patterns, accident severity, and contributing factors across time, location, and weather conditions.

### üèÜ Key Deliverables  
- **OLAP Cube Development:** Designed and deployed a multidimensional OLAP cube using SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS), enabling efficient slicing and dicing of accident data by time, state, severity, and weather conditions.  
- **ETL Workflow:** Built ETL pipelines using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to clean, transform, and load large-scale raw data into the data warehouse.  
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Developed insightful dashboards and pivot reports using Power BI and Excel to visualize accident trends and identify high-risk patterns.  
- **Data Mining:** Applied clustering and association techniques to discover non-obvious patterns (e.g., severity hotspots, weather-accident correlations).  

### üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack  
- **SSAS (OLAP):** Designed dimensions (e.g., Date, Location, Weather), hierarchies, and calculated measures (e.g., total accidents, average severity).  
- **SSIS (ETL):** Created automated ETL workflows for consistent and scalable data preparation.  
- **Power BI / Excel:** Delivered user-friendly visual analytics for decision-makers.  
- **MDX:** Wrote custom MDX queries for advanced analytical scenarios (e.g., trend analysis by region and time).  
- **Data Mining:** Conducted exploratory mining to support deeper decision-making insights.

### üìà Impact  
This OLAP solution empowers transportation analysts and city planners to better understand traffic accident trends, identify risk factors, and support data-driven policy or safety interventions.
